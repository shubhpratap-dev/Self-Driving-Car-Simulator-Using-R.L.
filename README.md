# Self-Driving-Car-Simulator-Using-R.L.
This project simulates a basic self-driving car using computer vision techniques and machine learning. The system detects lanes, processes video input, and makes steering decisions in real-time â€” mimicking the behavior of an autonomous vehicle.

A project to simulate autonomous vehicle behavior using AI and sensors

Introduction Provide a brief overview of your project. Mention its purpose, what it simulates, and why it is useful.

Features List out key features your simulator offers, such as:

Realistic road and traffic simulation

Integration with deep learning models for autonomous control

Sensor data processing (LIDAR, camera, etc.)

Customizable environments for testing different scenarios

Reinforcement learning for decision-making
